1. Problem
Note: The main parts of the statements of the problems "Reversort" and "Reversort Engineering" are identical, except for the last paragraph. The problems can otherwise be solved independently.
Reversort is an algorithm to sort a list of distinct integers in increasing order. The algorithm is based on the "Reverse" operation. Each application of this operation reverses the order of some contiguous part of the list.
The pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:
Reversort(L):
  for i := 1 to length(L) - 1
    j := position with the minimum value in L between i and length(L), inclusive
    Reverse(L[i..j])

2. Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 lines.
The first line contains a single integer N, representing the number of elements in the input list.
The second line contains N distinct integers L1, L2, ... , LN representing
the elements of the input list L in order.

3. Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is
the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the total cost of executing
Reversort on the list given as input.

1. Problem

In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.
Given an array of n distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. 
A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first k elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the
last k elements are in decreasing order, where k = (n +  1)/2 . You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.

2. Example
- Input: [2, 3, 5, 1 4]
- Output: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]

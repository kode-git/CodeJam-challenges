# Gym: Coding Interview Training

Welcome to Gym, a repository for coding interview training. This repository is intended to help software engineers prepare for technical interviews by providing a collection of practice problems and solutions in a variety of programming languages.

## Contents

Gym contains a variety of coding challenges, algorithms and data structures organized by difficulty and topic. Each challenge includes a prompt and sample test cases, as well as one or more solutions in a range of programming languages.

## How to Use

To use Gym, simply browse through the directories and files in the repository to find a problem that you'd like to practice. You can then use the provided prompt and test cases to try solving the problem on your own, and compare your solution to the provided ones to check your work.

## Contribution

# Gym: Coding Interview Training

Welcome to Gym, a repository for coding interview training. This repository is intended to help software engineers prepare for technical interviews by providing a collection of practice problems and solutions in a variety of programming languages.

## Contents

Gym contains a variety of coding challenges, algorithms and data structures organized by three main directories. Each challenges contains one or more function and a local runtime to test the solution on despite use cases. Feel free to improve the code if you have a less complex and efficient solution. 
In the following table, we will resume the structure of the main repository

| Folder | Scope | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| data | Data Structures | Defines a list of classes and snippet of code to generate various data structures used in algorithms. |
| challenges | Challenges and Problem Solving | This folder contains various problems with a single test case inside a main function, you can improve the complexity of code adding some alternative solution. |
| algo | Algorithms | Defines a list of implemented algoritms connected to main concepts defines in the literature. |

## How to Use

To use Gym, simply browse through the directories and files in the repository to find a problem that you'd like to practice. You can then use the provided prompt and test cases to try solving the problem on your own, and compare your solution to the provided ones to check your work.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to Gym. If you have a solution to a problem that is not currently included, or if you have a new problem that you'd like to add, please feel free to create a pull request with your contribution.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the problems and solutions in this repository are intended for educational and practice purposes only. They may not necessarily reflect the types of problems that will be asked in an actual coding interview.
